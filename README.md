LVR Coq
=======

**Authors:** _Martin Jakomin_ & _Mateja Rojko_

Some sorting algorithms proved by Coq, created as a project work at course LVR (Logic in Computer Science).
Project contains the sorting algorithms and their proof of correctness.
___


## Algorithms

* Insertion Sort.
* Selection Sort (Work in progress).

## Project structure
 * `Coq/` contains the source code:
   * `Coq/insertion_sort.v` contains the insertion sort and its proof.   
   * `Coq/selection_sort.v` contains the selection sort and its proof.
   * `Coq/sort_lectures.v` contains some useful lemmas used in our proofs (property of [Andrej Bauer](https://github.com/andrejbauer))
